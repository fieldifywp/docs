Fieldify is available as a Composer package. You can install it in your plugin or theme by following these steps:

<Steps>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Require the package with Composer:

        ```
        composer require fieldify/fields
        ```
        </li>

        <li>
        Require the Composer autoloader in your plugin or theme:

        ```php
        require_once __DIR__ . 'vendor/autoload.php';
        ```
        </li>

        <li>
        Create a new instance of Fieldify and pass in the path to the main plugin or theme file:

        ```php
        Fieldify::register( __FILE__ );
        ```
        </li>
    </ol>

</Steps>

Now you can start using Fieldify functions in your plugin or theme.
