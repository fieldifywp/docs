Fieldify is a PHP library that makes it easy to create custom meta boxes, blocks, and plugin settings in WordPress. It provides a simple and intuitive API that allows you to define fields and render them in the WordPress admin interface, without needing React or a build step.

## Installation

Fieldify is available as a Composer package. You can install it in your plugin or theme by following these steps:

<Steps>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Require the package with Composer:

            ```
            composer require fieldify/fields
            ```
        </li>

        <li>
            Require the Composer autoloader in your plugin or theme:

            ```php
            require_once __DIR__ . 'vendor/autoload.php';
            ```
        </li>

        <li>
            Create a new instance and pass in the path to the main plugin or theme file:

            ```php
            Fieldify::register( __FILE__ );
            ```
        </li>
    </ol>

</Steps>

Now you can start using Fieldify functions in your plugin or theme!
